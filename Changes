Revision history for FrameNet-WordNet-Detour

0.96 09/27/05
     - Fixed several bugs in the demo code
     - get_all_framenames in the Data class now works and returns a reference
     - Fixed a bug in Detour.pm that causes WordNet::QueryData to produce
       a lot of error messages	
     - Fixed a bug: 'word#pos' now returns a list reference with 
       "empty result" if no result found  
     - query() now recognizes immediately if no synset is given and returns a nice
       error message
     - updated documentation of the detour script

0.95 08/22/05
     - Fixed bug, which resulted in choosing the wrong cache
     - Better Accessibility of the interesting properties via the
       Data-object. Additional methods:
       * get_number_of_frames
       * get_weight 
       * get_fees
       * get_frame
       * get_best_weight
     - Better documentation of the Data-object
     - Fixed a bug in the command line script ("-l" did not run
       the detour in limited mode)
     - Fixed a bug in the verbose output
     - Command line interface is now called "detour" instead of "Detour"

0.94 08/02/05
     - Fixed Makefile bugs
     - It is now possible to give the path to WordNet and FrameNet 
       as arguments to new()

0.93 07/23/05
     - Improved Caching
     - Semantics of WNHOME is now identically with it in other 
       WordNet-related modules
     - Detour can now initialize its own QueryData and Similarity
       objects. In the new-method, they should left out by now. This
       improves the performance of your scripts severly, since queries
       that are already cached are answered now without need of the
       QueryData-object, which takes around 15 seconds to load

0.92 07/22/05
     - More documentation
     - Introduced a command-line interface called Detour:
       * located in bin/
       * shows the basic use of the Detour
       * requires additional modules: Getopt::Long and Pod::Usage
     - Improvements on the robustness of the Detour

0.91 07/22/05
     - Better testing capabilities
     - More compatibility with CPAN
     - More (and better) documentation

0.90 07/21/05
     - Initial Release
