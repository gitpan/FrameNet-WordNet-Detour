Revision history for FrameNet-WordNet-Detour

0.94 08/02/05
     - Fixed Makefile bugs
     - It is now possible to give the path to WordNet and FrameNet 
       as arguments to new()

0.93 07/23/05
     - Improved Caching
     - Semantics of WNHOME is now identically with it in other 
       WordNet-related modules
     - Detour can now initialize its own QueryData and Similarity
       objects. In the new-method, they should left out by now. This
       improves the performance of your scripts severly, since queries
       that are already cached are answered now without need of the
       QueryData-object, which takes around 15 seconds to load

0.92 07/22/05
     - More documentation
     - Introduced a command-line interface called Detour:
       * located in bin/
       * shows the basic use of the Detour
       * requires additional modules: Getopt::Long and Pod::Usage
     - Improvements on the robustness of the Detour

0.91 07/22/05
     - Better testing capabilities
     - More compatibility with CPAN
     - More (and better) documentation

0.90 07/21/05
     - Initial Release
